# Grocery Prediction
This is a multi-class classification project for Business Analytics course during my exchange semester at Sungkyunkwan University in South Korea. The purpose is to practice using traditional machine learning as well as trying out neural network models.

The project included below steps.
- Downloading <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/instacart-market-basket-analysis" target="_blank">Instacart Market Basket Analysis</a> from Kaggle
- Data clean-up and preparation using Python
- Using machine learning and deep learning models (KNN, XGBoost, CNN, DNN, RNN) to predict five grocery categories (frozen, beverages, produce, snacks, dairy eggs)
- Using Weka to perform feature selection
- Comparing model performance metrics (Accuracy, ROC score, confusion matrix, precision, recall, F1-score)

Key Takeaway & Future Improvements
- more advanced feature extraction
- hyperparameter tuning
